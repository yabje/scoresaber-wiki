# Modding Queue Information

## What is this about?
The Modding Queue Category on our Discord Server is a category designed to promote **individual Modding queues** and to advertise open mods from people willing to take them.

If you wish to request a slot from a modder, please DM them, and they'll (hopefully) get back to you on whether they decide to take your offer.
> **Please always make changes to your map, and if you aren't, please provide ample justification!**
> **Please respect the modders!**

## How to apply

If you wish to set up a Modding queue yourself, please DM `"Dog" (AFriendlyPug#7901)` via Discord, and send the requirements below, and they'll create you a channel with permissions for you.



If you post anything inappropriate your channel will be removed, and you will be banned from requesting a new Modding queue.

## Requirements
Please send `"Dog" (AFriendlyPug#7901)`via Discord the following items when requesting a Modding queue:

1. A link to your [ScoreSaber](https://scoresaber.com) account, if it exists.
2. Two [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com/) links or two map files. Maps must be serious and have reasonable effort put in.
> We expect at least basic understanding and use of timing, consistency, and correct use of rhythm choices.

- Response times can range from 1-5 days.

- If you do not send at least the second item you will not be eligible for a community modding queue.
- If you are a RT or QAT member or have a queue made for you before 04/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY), you are exempt from these requirements.
